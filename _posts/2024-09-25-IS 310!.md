# IS310: Computing in the Humanities - Fall 2024

## Course Overview

**IS310: Culture as Data** explores how computational methods can be applied to understand, analyze, and visualize cultural data. The course merges the study of digital humanities and data science, providing students with tools to work with diverse forms of cultural artifacts and datasets.

### Key Learning Goals

- **Understand Cultural Data:** Learn to conceptualize culture as data, analyzing everything from digital texts to multimedia.
- **Apply Computational Methods:** Gain hands-on experience with markup, algorithms, and data visualization to interpret cultural phenomena.
- **Critical Data Approaches:** Explore concepts like data feminism and algorithmic bias to develop a critical perspective on how data is constructed and used in cultural contexts.

## Weekly Breakdown

### **Tuesdays (Explorations)**
Focused on theoretical and conceptual understanding:
- **Weeks 1-2:** Introduction to digital objects and culture as data
- **Weeks 3-5:** Discussions on data feminism and critical algorithmic studies
- **Weeks 6-8:** Study of text modeling and network analysis in cultural data
- **Weeks 9-12:** Social media as data and ethical considerations

### **Thursdays (Experimentations)**
Practical workshops for technical skills:
- **Markup and Web Standards:** Learn XML, HTML, and CSS to structure and present cultural data.
- **Data Visualization:** Explore tools like D3.js to visualize trends in cultural datasets.
- **Algorithmic Failures:** Hands-on work with flawed models and bias detection in data-driven systems.

## Course Assignments
Assignments include a combination of coding challenges, data analysis tasks, and critical essays. Group projects focus on collaboratively building tools or analyses of cultural datasets, culminating in a final presentation that integrates both the technical and theoretical elements of the course.
